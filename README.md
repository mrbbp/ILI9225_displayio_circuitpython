# ILI9225_displayio_circuitpython

a simple driver for ILI9225 TFT display, for using with displayIo and tileGrid from adafruit. 
Coded with ChatGPT with ST7735R driver format.  
There is no rotation added, and display is in portrait mode.  
This is more an experiment with ai agent (Mistral.ai vs Claude.ai vs ChatGPT) than a true driver. But i think this a clean start for implement more feature.
