# ILI9225_displayio_circuitpython

a simple driver for ILI9225 TFT display, for using with displayIo and tileGrid from adafruit.  
Coded with ChatGPT with ST7735R driver as model.  
There is no rotation added, and display is in portrait mode.  
This is more an experiment with ai agent (Mistral.ai vs Claude.ai vs ChatGPT) than a true driver. But i think this is a clean start for implement more features.
